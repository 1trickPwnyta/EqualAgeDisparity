Did you know that in vanilla RimWorld, there is a mechanic that causes male colonists to prefer dating younger people and female colonists to prefer dating older people? It's not a rule or guarantee by any means, but the mechanic does skew romance in that direction.

This mod removes the gendered skew and makes all colonists have equal preference for both younger and older partners.
